		<p>The description of the video reads "** Warning: lots of censored potty language and inappropriate improvisation in this video! ** It was about time we brought to you another compilation of our failings!! And there’s been so /many/ mistakes since the last one, this video is only focusing on the last three Sanders Sides episodes! Hope you enjoy this smorgasbord of silliness!! Bloopers from this episode came from the following Sanders Sides episodes: Learning New Things About Ourselves, EMBARRASSING PHASES: The Nightmare Instead of Christmas!, Selfishness v. Selflessness. HUGE thank you to my friends, Quil and Adri, who went through the TONS of raw footage from these episodes and found all these moments to make this video possible! Also, a GIGANTIC thank you to my friend, Dahlia, who cut up all the raw footage for me to then be able to arrange it! Also, I think you can see through this raw footage just how much time Joan also dedicates to the filming of these videos! I wanna especially thank them for being there so much, helping me make these videos happen!! And, of course, I want to give a HUMONGOUS thank you, once again, to everyone else who was helping out with these Sanders Sides episodes that you saw in this raw footage! And a GINORMOUS thank you, once again, to Lev, for helping to create the thumbnail for this video!!"</p>

		<h2>BLOOPER REEL!! The Bloop Awakens!</h2>

		<p>The description of the video reads "WARNING: This video has a LOT of foul language, innuendo, and conversation (a lot of which was probably inspired by discussions of intrusive thoughts)! Please watch with caution!! You guys have all been asking for more Sanders Sides bloopers, so we finally bring you our blunders, shenanigans, and behind-the-scenes footage from the most recent Sanders Sides and Sanders Asides episodes, Dealing with INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS and Are There Healthy Distractions? Strangely, this video only encompasses two videos, but is our longest blooper reel yet!! I don’t know if that’s because we’re getting sillier while we film, or if I just wanna show you more of what happens behind the scenes, but, either way, I hope you don’t mind!! Please enjoy this chaotic but fun video!"</p>
