			<strong>Remus Sanders</strong> (previously known as The Duke) is Thomas' sixth Side and the second Dark Side revealed. He represents the dark side of Thomas' creativity and imagination, the reflection of his "twin" Roman Sanders.
			</article>
			<article class="item">
			<h2>Etymology</h2>
				<p>His name is derived from the name of Romulus' brother Remus whom the former killed before founding the Roman empire. This was confirmed to by Thomas in a public live stream on July 4th.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="item">
			<h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
				<h3>Current</h3>
				<p>Remus wears a sparkly Stuart era duke outfit in black and green, almost the inverted colors of Roman except for the green. The costume is accented with horror elements such as human teeth and an eyeball. He has a silver quiff in his hair, a curly mustache, and bruise-colored eye makeup.</p>

			<h2>Characteristics</h2>
				<p>Much like Roman, Remus is prone to reckless words and behavior. He himself says that there is no rhyme or reason to what [he] do[es]; [he] just do[es]! He craves attention, and being ignored or (figuratively) dressed down drives him to act even more chaotically.</p>
<p>Overall, Remus is a proudly demented character. His first appearance is defined largely by making the other sides and Thomas uncomfortable by pulling the topic of conversation to obscene subjects such as brutal violence and/or sexual acts.</p>
<p>He's also by far the most physically violent side: while Virgil threatens and intimidates, and Janus employs emotional manipulation, Remus knocks Roman unconscious with a morningstar in his debut, and later assaults Logan with a shuriken and his own teeth. He has no qualms against physically attacking people to get his way, or just because [he's] unpredictable like that.</p>
<p>Somewhat paradoxically, Remus seems deeply offended when Thomas calls him "scary". This suggests that Remus' main desire is for Thomas to implement his brand of creativity, and antagonizing the other sides is an (appreciated) side effect. Or because, as Logan says, the Duke only has power over [Thomas] because Virgil and Patton believe that he does.</p>
<p>In contrast to Janus, who lies almost constantly, Remus is honest to the extreme, going so far as revealing his name the same episode he first appears. This is because he represents pure, unfiltered thought, including the harsh truth.</p>
<p>Remus' speech is peppered with religious references such as Cain and Abel, the tree of knowledge, and even says that [he] was the unloved brother from the Genesis. This is because part of him stems from Thomas' Catholic upbringing and religious guilt.</p>
<p>One of Remus' hobbies is eating deodorant. You can see him doing this multiple times in Dealing with INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS.</p>

			<h2>Relationships</h2>
				<h3>Roman</h3>
				<p>Remus is described as like Roman's "twin" by Logan, and when that is said, Remus states that he and Roman are like Cain and Abel. When Roman awakens Remus says that Thomas should make his videos but hold the Roman lettuce (meaning keep Roman out of them) because he'll make Thomas "sick," and most of his actions toward Roman in Dealing with INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS are negative.</p>
				<h3>Virgil</h3>
				<p>Remus and Virgil have an unknown pre-established relationship, as Virgil clearly recognizes Remus upon his first appearance in Dealing with INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS. Remus speaks to Virgil in a familiar manner and pokes fun at him, even stating that seeing him was just like old times. However, Remus also goads Virgil by saying he could never stop being the bad guy after Logan points out Virgil's reactions are a source of Thomas' lack of sleep, and also stares at Virgil after revealing his name and stating to Thomas I would never hide anything from you.</p>
				<h3>Janus</h3>
				<p>Remus tries to summon Janus during Dealing with INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS. He also makes reference to him during the musical sequence for his song, where he sings that recently a snake offered [him] a morsel from the Tree of Knowledge. There is no real established relationship between the two at the moment, but they seem to know of each other well. Janus mentions Remus in Putting Others First, saying to Roman, Thank god you don't have a mustache. Otherwise between you and Remus, I wouldn't know who the evil twin is.</p>
